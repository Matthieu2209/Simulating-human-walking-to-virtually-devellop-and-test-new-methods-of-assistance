# Simulating-human-walking-to-virtually-devellop-and-test-new-methods-of-assistance
Repository used by Matthieu AUSSEMS and Nicolas DINEUR for the development of the Robotran model of the human walking based on the Geyer's model as part of their thesis

# User_function
The following 3 codes contain the functions to be used in Joint_forces to obtain the torques to be applied to the joints.

Muscle actuation layer : Functions use for the Muscle actuation layer

Neural control layer : Functions use for the neural control layer

Useful function : Functions useful

The following codes are used for validation of functions with exported signals from simulink in excel files:

Muscle_test : Test of muscle layer functions

Muscle_stimulation_test : test of muscle layer functions and neural control layers functions
